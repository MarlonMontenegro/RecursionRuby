# Fibonacci and Merge Sort
Description
This repository contains solutions to two programming exercises: Fibonacci Sequence generation and Merge Sort implementation.

Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The problem involves generating the Fibonacci Sequence using both iterative and recursive methods.

# Understanding Recursive Fibonacci
If you find it challenging to understand the recursive solution, there are additional resources provided to help you grasp the concept. Consider watching the Khan Academy's "Stepping Through Recursive Fibonacci Function" video or reading the "Recursive Fibonacci Explained" article.

Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a "divide and conquer" approach to efficiently sort an array. The problem involves implementing the Merge Sort algorithm using recursion.
